# hello-world

Hi Animate Beings!

My name is la-dolce-matematica and I live in Boston, MA. I started learning computer programming while getting my masters degree in something totally unrelated to CS. I graduated cum laude from my undergraduate degree in International Relations and started warming up to quantitative stuff with my minor in economics. I had sworn off math/stats until I took a required International Economics class and (somehow, despite being totally pessimistic about the outcome) got an A+. Then, I minored in economics, fell in love with the graphs and started to realize that maybe there was a chance I would consider taking math classes.

At this point, I'm very proficient in R but I want to learn more. The biggest issue I have with learning more computer science is that my background is in charity work and working with low-income/marginalized populations, so I can't seem to get past the motivational block that keeps leading me believe that computer science skills are not necessary to my career.

Simultaneously, I am pretty much 99% sure that computer science skills are necessary to all careers, so it is fun to think about ways to innovate in the gap between programming and charity work. If you want to message me about this area, please do! I'm always looking for new ideas about how to help people or even just shoot the shit about moral/ethical frustration and existential crises. 

I also wanted to make a shout out to Ben Schmidty's NLP stuff on GitHub. It pretty much changed my life because it was the perfect introduction to complex computer programming stuff for me. Here is his website: http://bookworm.benschmidt.org/posts/2015-10-25-Word-Embeddings.html If you have a similar background to me, you might like doing some of the projects and you might learn a bunch from trying to replicate his stuff on your own data.
